Performance:

V8 scored many huge performance leaps over other JavaScript engines when it was launched.
The V8 designers don't see a way to make the next huge leap with JavaScript.
Dart was designed from the start to be a language for a fast VM.
- Snapshotting - uses browser cache mechanism to store the a representation of the heap after initialization. 

DeltaBlue: one-way constraint solver.
The main focus in DeltaBlue is on polymorphism and object-oriented programming.

Dart VM: Dart benchmark harness on the Dart VM
Dart2js compiles the harness to JavaScript and run in V8.
V8 generated using same benchmarks written in JavaScript and same harness in JavaScript
